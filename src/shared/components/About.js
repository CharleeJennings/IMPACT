      My name is Era'Nisha Kidd. I am a full time student, model, & owner of NishaK Crochet.
My brand, NishaK Crochet, is all about confidence. This is the reason why I create custom crochet items for all sizes. We live in a world where if you're not the "perfect" size, color, or shape you aren't beautiful. God made us all different for a reason. We are all unique in our own way. I love lifting people up and staying positive is always an daily initiative. I hope with NishaK Crochet, you will pick something that YOU love, pick a color that's outside your box, and JUST BE YOU, because you are beautiful!
